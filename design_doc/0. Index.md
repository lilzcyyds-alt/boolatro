# Design Doc Index

> Rule: **Every feature** needs a corresponding doc in this folder.

## Core

- `1. Overview.md`
- `2. Architecture.md`
- `2.1_phase_flow.md`

## Proof System

- `2.2_proof_core.md` — pure Dart ProofCore (generator/validator/rules)
- `2.3_proof_ui.md` — Phase 3 Proof UI + blind loop + settlement

## Shop / Special Cards (Effects)

- `2.4_shop_and_effects.md` — Phase 4 baseline: ShopState + Effect system + sample cards (WIP)

## Conventions

- Prefer a new doc per feature/vertical slice.
- Keep docs implementation-facing: data models, state ownership, UI flow, and TODOs.
