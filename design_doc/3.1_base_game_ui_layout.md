# 3.1 Base Game UI Layout (16:9) (Feature)

## Goal

Replace the current "dev overlay" with a **game-like baseline layout** that:
- is locked to **16:9** aspect ratio
- has a consistent **HUD** across phases
- keeps the **Hand** at the bottom
- uses a **right-side drawer** for the Proof editor (no modal)

This is the foundation for later visual polish (animations, card art, etc.).

## Layout (16:9)

We render the whole game inside:

- `Center → AspectRatio(16/9) → ClipRRect → Container`

So the game has a stable stage regardless of window size.

## Regions

### Top HUD (persistent)

Displays:
- Phase label
- Money
- Blind progress (Score / Target)
- Hands remaining

### Main Stage (center)

- Phase-specific content (Start / SelectBlind / Proof / Cashout / Shop)
- Proof phase shows:
  - Premise
  - Current conclusion string

### Bottom Hand Bar (persistent in Proof)

- Hand buttons (tokens)
- Quick actions: Backspace / Clear / Edit Proof (opens drawer)

## Proof Editor (Right Drawer)

- Implemented using `Scaffold.endDrawer`
- Opened from the Proof phase via an "Edit Proof" button
- Contains:
  - premise as Line 1
  - proof lines list (Line 2+)
  - Add Line / Clear / Submit
  - validation + score feedback

## State Ownership

- `RunState` remains the source of truth.
- Drawer open/close is controlled by `ScaffoldState` in `GameScreen`, with a callback passed down.

## TODO (Later)

- Replace text blocks with card-like widgets (Premise card, Blind card)
- Add animations for phase transitions
- Add shop card grid and reroll UI
- Keyboard shortcuts (desktop)
