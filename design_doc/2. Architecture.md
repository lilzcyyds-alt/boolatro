# 2. Architecture

We follow the **cruising** pattern:

- **Single root screen** owns a **Ticker-based loop** (dt seconds)
- **Single source of truth** is a `ChangeNotifier` state object
- UI is primarily an overlay stack driven by state

## Current (Phase 1)

- `RunState` (ChangeNotifier)
  - holds current phase
  - exposes simple transition methods
- `GameScreen`
  - owns ticker loop
  - renders a minimal overlay per phase

## Planned (Phase 2+)

- `proof_core/` becomes pure Dart modules (no Flutter dependency)
  - generator / validator / score
- `phases/` orchestrate phase entry/exit logic
- `ui/` contains widgets for each phase
