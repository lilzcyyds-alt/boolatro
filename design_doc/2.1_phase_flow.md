# 2.1 Phase Flow

## Target flow (matches Unity prototype at a high level)

Start → SelectBlind → Proof → Cashout → Shop → SelectBlind → …

## Notes

- `Proof` phase will eventually own the per-blind loop:
  - generate task (premise)
  - player selects/builds conclusion
  - proof editor (lines + rules + citations)
  - submit → validate → score
  - if score >= requirement → Cashout, else consume handsRemaining and continue
